Refactoring guide (What I did in no particular order):
- Created a Makefile to handle my commands.
- set up `sqlc` and `testify` for generating Golang code from SQL and testing my methods and functions respectively.
- set up golang migrate and created migration folder.
- redesigned the database schema using `dbdiagram.io`, exported to PostgreSQL and ran the migration file for it.
- created `util` package for utilities such as generating random numbers, mobile numbers, strings, names, emails and passwords (with a test package for password method).
- set up the tests for db connection, and `user.sql.go` which creates a new user account, gets a new user account by ID, list all existing user accounts, updates the existing information of the user's account and deletes the user account.
- added github actions workflow to perform tests
- added api folder to handle api serving and routing
- added gin for api management
- wrote CRUD operations for users accounts
- created a server file to handle creation of a new server, error responses and starting of the server
- added config.go which uses viper to load configs and env variables
- updated `main.go` to load the configs from config.go and start the server
- accounts: wrote sql query to perform CRUD operations for accounts, added method to Get accounts by specific user ID. Wrote tests for the DB query package for accounts
- budgets: wrote sql query to perform CRUD operations for budgets, added method to Get budget by specific user ID. Wrote tests for the DB query package for budgets.
- Todo: write API for budget, write tests for accounts and budgets API
